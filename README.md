🕊️ Tribute Page Web Application

Oasis Infobyte – Web Development Internship | Task 2

📌 Project Description

The Tribute Page Web Application is a responsive front-end project developed as part of Task 2 of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship.
This project presents a tribute to a notable personality using a clean and well-organized layout with engaging visuals and smooth interactivity.

The application is built using HTML for semantic structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactive elements.
The primary focus of this project is to deliver an intuitive user interface, maintain content readability, and ensure compatibility across multiple devices.

This project contributed to strengthening my foundational skills in **front-end web development**, particularly in layout design, responsive styling, and basic DOM manipulation.
